            <br />
            You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
            your password. It is important that you protect it against
            unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your
            password carefully, and keeping your password and computer secure by
            signing out after using our services. <br />
            <br />

            third parties to provide you additional services, you are
            responsible for all actions taken with your login information and
            password and therefore should review each third party's privacy

            information and password, including fees. If you lose control of
            your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally
            identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding
            actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been
            compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your
            password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any
            consistent unauthorized use of your account or access to your

            collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information
            to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or on other sites
            throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or
            disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent
            that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own
            privacy policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of
            third parties, you are subject to ask questions before you disclose

            <span className="text-secondary">SECURITY</span>
            <br />
            We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
            unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to
            protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and
            outside the company. We do not recommend transfer of sensitive
            information (such as credit card number) and bank account details
            via the Site to other Users. Users are recommended to do so offline,
            on the phone or via personal emails. We follow generally accepted
            industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to
            us, both during transmission and once We receive it. However,
            "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. You therefore
            agree that any security breaches beyond the control of our standard
            security procedures are at your sole risk and discretion. <br />
            <br />
            <span className="text-secondary">DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION </span>
            <br />
            All disputes involving but not limited to rights conferred,
            compensation, refunds, and other claims through this policy will be
            resolved through a two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism.{' '}
            <br />
            Stage 1: Mediation: In case of a dispute, the matter will first be
            attempted to be resolved by a sole mediator who is a neutral third
            party and will be selected at the mutual acceptance of a proposed
            mediator by both parties. Both parties may raise a name for sole
            arbitrator and in case both parties accept the proposed name, the
            said person shall be appointed as sole mediator. In any case the
            parties are not able to reach a consensus within two proposed
            mediators, the Company reserves the right to decide who the final
            mediator is. The decision of the mediator is not binding on both
            parties, however the parties in good faith will attempt to bind by
            the decision. <br /> Stage 2: Arbitration: In case that mediation
            does not yield a result suitable or preferred by any one of the
            parties, arbitration may follow, the award of which is binding on
            both parties. The Arbitration Board shall comprise three members â€“
            one appointed by each party and the third member to be nominated by
            the two appointed members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be
            held at Delhi, India. The proceedings of arbitration shall be in the
            English language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding
            on the Parties. If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step
            Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism, it shall be referred to the
            courts at Delhi, India. <br />

              Our Platform's online requisition form requires users to give us
              contact information (like your name, address, telephone number and
              email address), and demographic information (like your zip
              code/pin code). As a member, you are required to provide a valid
              email address at registration and choose a username or alias that
              represents your identity on our Website. This information is
              compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may
              include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on
              the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on
              the Site or not), your computer browser information, your IP
              address, and other information associated with your interaction
              with the Site.
              <br />
              We also collect and store personal information provided by you
              from time to time on the Site. We only collect and use such
              information from you that we consider necessary for achieving a
              seamless, efficient and safe experience, customized to your needs
              including:
              <br />
              To enable the provision of services opted for by you;
              <br />
              To communicate necessary account and product/service-related
              information from time to time;
              <br />
              To allow you to receive quality customer care services;
              <br />
              To undertake necessary fraud and money laundering prevention
              checks, and comply with the highest security standards;
              <br />
              To comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations; and
              <br />
              To provide you with information and offers on products and
              services, updates, promotions, and related, affiliated or
              associated service providers and partners, that we believe would
              be of interest to you.
              <br />
              Where any service requested by you involves a third party, such
              information as is reasonably necessary by the Company to carry out
              your service request may be shared with a such third party.
              <br />
              We also do use your contact information to send you offers based
              on your interests and prior activity. The Company may also use
              contact information internally to direct its efforts for product
              improvement, to contact you as a survey respondent, to notify you
              if you win any contest; and to send you promotional materials from
              its contest sponsors or advertisers.
              <br />
              Further, you may from time to time choose to provide
              payment-related financial information (credit card, debit card,
              bank account details, billing address etc.) on the Site. We are
              committed to keeping all such sensitive data/information safe at
              all times and ensure that such data/information is only transacted
              over secure Sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally
              encrypted, and provide the highest possible degree of care
              available under the technology presently in use.
              <br />
              The Company will not use your financial information for any
              purpose other than to complete a transaction with you.
              <br />
              To the extent possible, we provide you with the option of not
              divulging any specific information that you wish for us not to
              collect, store or use. You may also choose not to use a particular
              service or feature on the Site, and opt out of any non-essential
              communications from the Company.
              <br />
              Further, transacting over the internet has inherent risks which
              can only be avoided by you following security practices yourself,
              such as not revealing account/login-related information to any
              other person and informing our customer care team about any
              suspicious activity or where your account has/may have been
              compromised.
