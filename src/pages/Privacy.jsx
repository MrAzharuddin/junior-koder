            <span className="text-secondary">CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD</span>
            <br />
            You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
            your password. It is important that you protect it against
            unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your
            password carefully, and keeping your password and computer secure by
            signing out after using our services. <br />
            <br />
            You agree not to use the account, username, email address or

            to any third party. If you choose to share this information with
            third parties to provide you additional services, you are
            responsible for all actions taken with your login information and
            password and therefore should review each third party's privacy
            policy. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login
            information and password, including fees. If you lose control of
            your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally
            identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding
            actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been
            compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your
            password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any
            consistent unauthorized use of your account or access to your

            Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this

            collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information
            to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or on other sites
            throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or
            disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent
            that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own
            privacy policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of
            third parties, you are subject to ask questions before you disclose

            <span className="text-secondary">SECURITY</span>
            <br />
            We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
            unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to
            protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and
            outside the company. We do not recommend transfer of sensitive
            information (such as credit card number) and bank account details
            via the Site to other Users. Users are recommended to do so offline,
            on the phone or via personal emails. We follow generally accepted
            industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to
            us, both during transmission and once We receive it. However,
            "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. You therefore
            agree that any security breaches beyond the control of our standard
            security procedures are at your sole risk and discretion. <br />
            <br />
            <span className="text-secondary">DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION </span>
            <br />
            All disputes involving but not limited to rights conferred,
            compensation, refunds, and other claims through this policy will be
            resolved through a two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism.{' '}
            <br />
            Stage 1: Mediation: In case of a dispute, the matter will first be
            attempted to be resolved by a sole mediator who is a neutral third
            party and will be selected at the mutual acceptance of a proposed
            mediator by both parties. Both parties may raise a name for sole
            arbitrator and in case both parties accept the proposed name, the
            said person shall be appointed as sole mediator. In any case the
            parties are not able to reach a consensus within two proposed
            mediators, the Company reserves the right to decide who the final
            mediator is. The decision of the mediator is not binding on both
            parties, however the parties in good faith will attempt to bind by
            the decision. <br /> Stage 2: Arbitration: In case that mediation
            does not yield a result suitable or preferred by any one of the
            parties, arbitration may follow, the award of which is binding on
            both parties. The Arbitration Board shall comprise three members â€“
            one appointed by each party and the third member to be nominated by
            the two appointed members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be
            held at Delhi, India. The proceedings of arbitration shall be in the
            English language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding
            on the Parties. If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step
            Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism, it shall be referred to the
            courts at Delhi, India. <br />

            <p>
              Our Platform's online requisition form requires users to give us
              contact information (like your name, address, telephone number and
              email address), and demographic information (like your zip
              code/pin code). As a member, you are required to provide a valid
              email address at registration and choose a username or alias that
              represents your identity on our Website. This information is
              compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may
              include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on
              the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on
              the Site or not), your computer browser information, your IP
              address, and other information associated with your interaction
              with the Site.
              <br />
              We also collect and store personal information provided by you
              from time to time on the Site. We only collect and use such
              information from you that we consider necessary for achieving a
              seamless, efficient and safe experience, customized to your needs
              including:
              <br />
              To enable the provision of services opted for by you;
              <br />
              To communicate necessary account and product/service-related
              information from time to time;
              <br />
              To allow you to receive quality customer care services;
              <br />
              To undertake necessary fraud and money laundering prevention
              checks, and comply with the highest security standards;
              <br />
              To comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations; and
              <br />
              To provide you with information and offers on products and
              services, updates, promotions, and related, affiliated or
              associated service providers and partners, that we believe would
              be of interest to you.
              <br />
              Where any service requested by you involves a third party, such
              information as is reasonably necessary by the Company to carry out
              your service request may be shared with a such third party.
              <br />
              We also do use your contact information to send you offers based
              on your interests and prior activity. The Company may also use
              contact information internally to direct its efforts for product
              improvement, to contact you as a survey respondent, to notify you
              if you win any contest; and to send you promotional materials from
              its contest sponsors or advertisers.
              <br />
              Further, you may from time to time choose to provide
              payment-related financial information (credit card, debit card,
              bank account details, billing address etc.) on the Site. We are
              committed to keeping all such sensitive data/information safe at
              all times and ensure that such data/information is only transacted
              over secure Sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally
              encrypted, and provide the highest possible degree of care
              available under the technology presently in use.
              <br />
              The Company will not use your financial information for any
              purpose other than to complete a transaction with you.
              <br />
              To the extent possible, we provide you with the option of not
              divulging any specific information that you wish for us not to
              collect, store or use. You may also choose not to use a particular
              service or feature on the Site, and opt out of any non-essential
              communications from the Company.
              <br />
              Further, transacting over the internet has inherent risks which
              can only be avoided by you following security practices yourself,
              such as not revealing account/login-related information to any
              other person and informing our customer care team about any
              suspicious activity or where your account has/may have been
              compromised.

            </h2>

              Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that
              all of your private communications and other personally
              identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not
              otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example
              (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose
              information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third
              parties. Under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully
              intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or
              members may abuse or misuse the information that they collect from
              our Website. Therefore, although we use industry standard
              practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you
              should not expect, that your personally identifiable information
              or private communications would always remain private.
              <br />
              As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally
              identifiable information about you to any third party. However,
              the following describes some of the ways that your personally
              identifiable information may be disclosed:
              <br />
              External Service Providers: There may be a number of services
              offered by external service providers that help you use our
              Websites. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the
              course of doing so, disclose information to the external service
              providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information
              about you, then their use of your information is governed by their
              private policy.
              <br />
              Other Corporate Entities: We share much of our data, including
              personally identifiable information about you, with our parents
              and/or subsidiaries that are committed to serving your online
              needs and related services, throughout the world. Such data will
              be shared for the sole purpose of enhancing your browsing
              experience and providing our services to you. To the extent that
              these entities have access to your information, they will treat it
              at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain
              from their other members. It is possible that We and/or its
              subsidiaries, or any combination of such, could merge with or be
              acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination
              occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your
              information in order to continue to provide the service. You will
              receive notice of such an event (to the extent that it occurs).
              <br />
              Law and Order: We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as
              well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as intellectual

              is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Following registration, you can review and change the information
              you submitted each time except your display name. If you change
              any information we may keep track of your old information. You can
              change your registration information such as name, address, city,
              state, zip code, country, phone number, and profile.
              <br />
              We will retain in our files the information you have requested to
              remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes,
              troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions.
              Further, such prior information is never completely removed from
              our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including
              stored 'backup' systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all
              of your personally identifiable information will be completely
              removed from our databases in response to your requests.

            <p>
              When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to
              choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining
              the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you
              protect it against unauthorized access to your account and
              information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your
              password and computer secure by signing out after using our
              services.
              <br />
              You agree not to use the account, username, email address or
              password of another Member at any time or to disclose your
              password to any third party. If you choose to share this
              information with third parties to provide you additional services,
              you are responsible for all actions taken with your login
              information and password and therefore should review each third
              party's privacy policy. You are responsible for all actions taken
              with your login information and password, including fees. If you
              lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control
              over your personally identifiable information and may be subject
              to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if
              your password has been compromised for any reason, you should
              immediately change your password. You agree to notify us
              immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use of your
              account or access to your password even after changing it.

              We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
              unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques
              to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside
              and outside the company. We do not recommend the transfer of
              sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) and bank
              account details via the Site to other Users. Users are recommended
              to do so offline, on the phone or via personal emails. We follow
              generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal
              information submitted to us, both during transmission and once We
              receive it. However, &quot;perfect security&quot; does not exist
              on the Internet. You, therefore, agree that any security breaches
              beyond the control of our standard security procedures are at your
              sole risk and discretion.

            <p>
              All disputes involving but not limited to rights conferred,
              compensation, refunds, and other claims through this policy will
              be resolved through a two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution
              mechanism.
              <br />
              Stage 1: Mediation. In case of a dispute, the matter will first be
              attempted to be resolved by a sole mediator who is a neutral third
              party and will be selected at the mutual acceptance of a proposed
              mediator by both parties. Both parties may raise a name for the
              sole arbitrator and in case both parties accept the proposed name,
              the said person shall be appointed as sole mediator. In any case,
              the parties are not able to reach a consensus between two proposed
              mediators, the Company reserves the right to decide who the final
              mediator is. The decision of the mediator is not binding on both
              parties, however, the parties in good faith will attempt to bind
              by the decision.
              <br />
              Stage 2: Arbitration. In case of mediation does not yield a result
              suitable or preferred by any one of the parties, arbitration may
              follow, the award of which is binding on both parties. The
              Arbitration Board shall comprise three members
              &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; one appointed by each party and the third
              member to be nominated by the two appointed members by mutual
              consent. The arbitration shall be held in Delhi, India. The
              proceedings of arbitration shall be in the English language. The
              arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be final and binding on the
              Parties. If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step
              Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism, it shall be referred to
              the courts in Delhi, India.
