            Following registration, you can review and change the information
            you submitted each time except your display name. If you change any

            for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot
            problems and enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior
            information is never completely removed from our databases due to
            technical and legal constraints, including stored 'back up' systems.
            Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally

            <span className="text-secondary">CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD</span>
            <br />
            You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
            your password. It is important that you protect it against
            unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your
            password carefully, and keeping your password and computer secure by
            signing out after using our services. <br />
            <br />
            You agree not to use the account, username, email address or
            password of another Member at any time or to disclose your password
            to any third party. If you choose to share this information with
            third parties to provide you additional services, you are
            responsible for all actions taken with your login information and
            password and therefore should review each third party's privacy
            policy. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login
            information and password, including fees. If you lose control of
            your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally
            identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding
            actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been
            compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your
            password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any
            consistent unauthorized use of your account or access to your
            password even after changing it. <br />

            Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this
            document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we
            collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information
            to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or on other sites
            throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or
            disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent
            that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own
            privacy policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of
            third parties, you are subject to ask questions before you disclose
            your personal information to others. <br />
            <br />
            <span className="text-secondary">SECURITY</span>
            <br />
            We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
            unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to
            protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and
            outside the company. We do not recommend transfer of sensitive
            information (such as credit card number) and bank account details
            via the Site to other Users. Users are recommended to do so offline,
            on the phone or via personal emails. We follow generally accepted
            industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to
            us, both during transmission and once We receive it. However,
            "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. You therefore
            agree that any security breaches beyond the control of our standard
            security procedures are at your sole risk and discretion. <br />
            <br />
            <span className="text-secondary">DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION </span>
            <br />
            All disputes involving but not limited to rights conferred,
            compensation, refunds, and other claims through this policy will be
            resolved through a two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism.{' '}
            <br />
            Stage 1: Mediation: In case of a dispute, the matter will first be
            attempted to be resolved by a sole mediator who is a neutral third
            party and will be selected at the mutual acceptance of a proposed
            mediator by both parties. Both parties may raise a name for sole
            arbitrator and in case both parties accept the proposed name, the
            said person shall be appointed as sole mediator. In any case the
            parties are not able to reach a consensus within two proposed
            mediators, the Company reserves the right to decide who the final
            mediator is. The decision of the mediator is not binding on both
            parties, however the parties in good faith will attempt to bind by
            the decision. <br /> Stage 2: Arbitration: In case that mediation
            does not yield a result suitable or preferred by any one of the
            parties, arbitration may follow, the award of which is binding on
            both parties. The Arbitration Board shall comprise three members â€“
            one appointed by each party and the third member to be nominated by
            the two appointed members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be
            held at Delhi, India. The proceedings of arbitration shall be in the
            English language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding
            on the Parties. If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step
            Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism, it shall be referred to the
            courts at Delhi, India. <br />
